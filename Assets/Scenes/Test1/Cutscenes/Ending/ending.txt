I think I'm here!
"Oh, hi there! Is this where the event is happening?"

I really enjoyed my time here.
I didn't really get to talk a lot, I guess I'm less confident in myself than I thought.
But everyone here was lovely
And I feel more serene...
Than I have ever been...
 ...
I can poems sometimes!
And
And I think I'll come back next week as well.
