Good morning snow!
Good morning morning!
And good morning me!
The morning sends her regards, with cold..
It is cold.
It is very cold.
I'm off to hang out with some people I don't know! No, it's probably not illegal? There's a new weekly event and it looks fun!
It's the kind of cold where I can't really get my thoughts together. Like brain freeze but, uh, of the brain?? A little scattered, I'll admit.
Oh I hope I make some friends.
Let's have a little amble along and see if I can find this event!
