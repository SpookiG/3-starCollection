Hmm.
I wonder what's over there?
I'm fairly sure we're on ground level. And that could be some ground in front of me.. 
But it could also be a big drop off of a high rise building?
I guess it's really interesting how often we just roll with the assumptions we make.
I mean, I of all people definately should not be confused here, If there was a drop, I would definately know, because I'm standing right here facing it.
Here I am though, I guess these thoughts were interesting enough to have for a little while.

Nothing to say this time.
                 
I'm just feeling very happy.

I can't not notice the snow.
Apologies, not the snow, that's obvious.
Powdery white ice on the floor during christmas? Who'd have thought!
But no, like, my shoes.
They make the same sounds, no matter what I'm walking on.
It's a little confusing.
But it's also calming, so I can't complain.
Shuffle on snowie shoes.

Ah right, yes! The fence oops.
Why is this fence here?
I feel like there isn't really a purpose to it, besides adding some aesthetic interest. And some boundaries!
                           
You know, I appreciate this fence.
Because of this fence, I'll be walking all the way around to get back home.
And I can have more time to think about things.
And I can look forward to where I'm headed, just a little more.
Thank you fence!

I'll be honest, I'm impressed I ended up here.
I am lost though.
...
Maybe that's not a bad thing?
I basically know where I am.
I just can't see.
I don't think I'll find anything else here.
It's always good to be curious though!

I wonder what happens if I try to think about more than one thing at a time?
Hmm, I'd better not walk around too much whilst I'm thinking.
Or maybe I should? You know, life's all about getting things mixed up!
And forgetting!
And confusing yourself!
So maybe I should, maybe I'll wonder around and all the words will come out wrong.
And maybe I'll love every second of it.
